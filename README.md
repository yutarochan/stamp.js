[Stamp.JS]

- Simlar to emojis, allows users to simply add stamps to their site.
- Users can create stamp sheets (base64 compressed files) and simply throw them in
as accents to their site.
- In the future, hope to create an opensource repo based stamp sheet where users
can call the stamp sheets from the repo and put stickers.

Implementation details and full documentation will be provided.
